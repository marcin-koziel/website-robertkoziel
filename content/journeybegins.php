                    &emsp;When I was about five years old, my mother heard me talking in my sleep late at night.
                    When she came into my room, she heard me whispering about someone playing piano. At that point,
                    I have never played piano, but that is when my journey of passion for music had begun....
                    and what inspired my first original album title, The Journey Begins. Recorded,
                    mixed and mastered at Queen Elizabeth Park Community & Cultural Centre in Oakville Ontario.
